Assignment #2: Password Cracker

Your script needs to accept a password entered by the user, crack it by brute force, and let the user know how many tries it took. For purposes of this project, your cracker only needs to handle 3 character passwords. The passwords can be composed of small letters, capital letters, and digits from 0 through 9. (If you can do this for 3 characters, you can later modify the script to handle more realistic passwords.) This script is based on loops and ASCII character codes. Turn in this script as a single file called Cracker.html.
