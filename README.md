Assignment #2: Password Cracker

Your script needs to accept a password entered by the user, crack it by brute force, and let the user know how many tries it took. For purposes of this project, your cracker only needs to handle 3 character passwords. The passwords can be composed of small letters, capital letters, and digits from 0 through 9. (If you can do this for 3 characters, you can later modify the script to handle more realistic passwords.) This script is based on loops and ASCII character codes. Turn in this script as a single file called Cracker.html.


Let's start with some pseudocode -

1) user enters 3 characters

2) program stores the 3 characters

3) program finds ascii number code for each of the characters

4) program has a variable for each ascii code of each character

Can you get it that far? If so, the rest is basically just running loops from some number to some number to see how long it takes to hit the code of each character.
